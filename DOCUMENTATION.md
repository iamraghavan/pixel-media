# API Documentation

This project uses Swagger for live, interactive API documentation.

## How to Access

1.  Run the server.
2.  Open your browser and navigate to the `/api-docs` endpoint.

For example, if your server is running locally on port 3001, the documentation would be available at:
[http://localhost:3001/api-docs](http://localhost:3001/api-docs)

All API documentation is now maintained in the JSDoc comments within the route files themselves.
